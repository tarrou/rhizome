# To add a file or files
First, we put them in the staging environment

```shell
git add <filename>
```

or, for everything that's been changed,

```shell
git add --all
```

Then we commit

```shell
git commit -m "The -m means you're adding this message."
```

# To get files back from github

```shell
git pull origin master
```
